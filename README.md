##Problem Statement

Understanding the customers’ intentions can help to improve the journey, e.g., by taking shortcuts or giving recommendations to improve the overall experience is very important. With the extent of development in the field of machine learning research, personalization of services has become very common. Typically, a user’s intention on a Web site can be understood by looking at their past interactions. In concrete terms, this means that a user leaves a sequence of events about the history of his page views and interactions. An event can be that a user makes a search query, calls up an article page or receives an e-mail. This data forms the basis for working with the following techniques. Therefore, the first step is to collect or extract this data.

In this world of big data, we have to use the data to predict the age group of their users based on their activity on social media activities. This will help them to divide their huge userbase and cater differently to each of them. Given this huge dataset, predict the age group of the users, the evaluation metric for the competition is the Weighted F1 score.

The Machine learning model you develop will help website owner to provide better experience to their users by giving them a better user age specific content which people might find more relatable.
